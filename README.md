# VMWare Serial extractor
This is a stupid PowerShell script to get the VMWare Workstation Pro product key.

## Usage:
- When running outside the console, just double clik it. A pop-up should come with the key.
- When running on console, chances are your environment is configured to prevent PS script execution, so you must type (on cmd.exe) ```powershell -ep bypass``` to bypass the execution policy and finally execute the program
